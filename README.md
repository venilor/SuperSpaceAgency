You're in charge of buying everything that goes on your private space company's missions while trying to cut as many corners and save as much money as possible.

Super Space Agency was originally pitched by Kamran Payne; developed by Cody Brown and Kamran Payne; features artwork from Joey Fisher; and has original music from Christopher Medrano and Scott Nubar. 

Made in 2 days for Indie Galactic Space Jam 2018
